the deploy folder is deployed directly to the roborio. Paths are sent here from pathweaver and end up
in the output, paths, and autos folders. You shouldn't need to worry about what goes where, it should do 
that automatically. Also make sure that pathweaver.json is in the pathweaver folder too. Outside of the pathweaver
folder, in deploy, you can put chrp files generated in phoenix tuner. As of 22/23 we have 6 falcon motors
on the robot so you should be able to play 6-track midi files as long as you add all of them. make a separate
branch for music because you cannot play music and drive at the same time because of how the motors are set
up for music.
