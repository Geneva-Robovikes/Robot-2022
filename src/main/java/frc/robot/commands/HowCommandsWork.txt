commands are what make subsystems work. They have a pretty consistent structure, as seen in ExampleCommand. 
Inside the already existing methods like initialize() and end(), you call the methods from the corresponding 
subsystem. 
initialize() is used to set what happens when the command is run, and end(boolean interrupted)
is what happens when the command stops. 
isFinished() should just return false.
The constructor (the method with the same name as the class) is where you make an object of the corresponding
subsystem and the line  addRequirements(subsystem name here); put in the name of the subsystem object you
just made. also make sure to say that the class extends commandbase and import commands and the subsystem you use.
The drive command will likely be written somewhat differently so you can probably copy some of that code from
the (recent) github, but make sure to change variables/object names to be consistent with your current code.
To make things much easier for yourself, make auto commands and teleop commands separately, even if they do
the same thing.
