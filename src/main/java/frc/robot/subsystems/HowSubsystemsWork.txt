subsystems are where you create motors/switches/etc and write methods for what they do. initialize them in
the constructor (the method with the name of the class) and then write methods to make them work/get data
if needed (limit switches).
DriveSubsystem is written in a very specific way, you can probably just copy our (recent) github code 
for that but make sure to change variable/object names so that everything lines up in your code.
Also make sure to check/set the indexes of the motors in phoenix tuner so that they are all unique - I think
they are all set to 0 by default so if only one is showing up change the index and more will appear.
Make sure that the subsystem extends subsystembase and that you import everything you will use.

Very Important - you are only Writing methods in subsystems. You never call them, that is done in their
corresponding command.
